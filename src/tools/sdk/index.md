The Dart SDK has the libraries and command-line tools that you need to develop
Dart apps. To learn about other tools you can use for Dart development, see
[Dart Tools](/tools).

The [DartPad][]{: target="_blank"} is a great way to learn how to write a simple
app in the Dart language, once you are ready to develop real apps, you need the
Dart SDK.

This site's documentation and examples use the
[{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.vers}}][site SDK version]{:.no-automatic-external}
release of the **Dart SDK**.

## Install the SDK

A package manager can help you easily install and update the Dart SDK.

<ul class="tabs__top-bar">
  <li class="tab-link current" data-tab="tab-sdk-install-windows">Windows</li>
  <li class="tab-link" data-tab="tab-sdk-install-linux">Linux</li>
  <li class="tab-link" data-tab="tab-sdk-install-mac">Mac</li>
</ul>
<div id="tab-sdk-install-windows" class="tabs__content current" markdown="1">
{% include_relative _windows.md %}
</div>
<div id="tab-sdk-install-linux" class="tabs__content" markdown="1">
{% include_relative _linux.md %}
</div>
<div id="tab-sdk-install-mac" class="tabs__content" markdown="1">
{% include_relative _mac.md %}
</div>

Alternatives:

- Not using a package manager for your OS? No problem!
  [Download](/install/archive)
  zip files of the Dart SDK and docs.
- Looking for an older version?
  Check out our [zip file archive](/install/archive) for
  previous versions of the Dart SDK.

## What's in the SDK

The SDK directory includes a `lib` directory for the
[Dart libraries](/guides/libraries/library-tour)
and a `bin` directory that has these command-line tools:

## About SDK release channels and version strings

The Dart SDK has two release channels:

* **stable** channel: **stable releases**,
  updated no more frequently than every 6 weeks;
  currently `[calculating]`{:.editor-build-rev-stable}.
* **dev** channel: **pre-releases**, usually updated 1/week;
  currently `[calculating]`{:.editor-build-rev-dev}.

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Warning:**
  To give you early access to new features and fixes,
  dev channel releases are not as heavily tested as the stable release.
</aside>

Most **alpha** releases of Flutter contain a **dev** channel release of Dart.

**Stable** channel releases of the Dart SDK have version strings like `1.24.2` and `2.0.0`.
They consist of dot-separated integers, with no hyphens or letters.

**Dev** channel releases of the Dart SDK (pre-releases)
have additional characters, starting with a hyphen (`-`).
Dart 2 pre-releases have version numbers starting with
`2.0.0-dev`â€”for example, `2.0.0-dev.42.0`.

For more information, see [Dart 2 Updates](/dart-2).
